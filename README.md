# BMI-calculator
This is a very simple program to calculate your Body Mass Index(BMI): based upon your height, weight ratio. Actually it follows the international standards of BMI calculation. It gives your weight density per unit area. 

The files related are (bmicalc.py and font.py).   "bmicalc.py"  is the main source code for this program which is made by mainly functions, loops and some methods. While, the "font.py" contains some awesome ASCII generated as functions which are imported into the main source code. Hope it helps some learner.
